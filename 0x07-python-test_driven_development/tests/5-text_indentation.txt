# How to print a string using text_indentation(text)

This function prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :

>>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
>>> text_indentation("Here's how this works. You created a bond? That's cool: but no")
Here's how this works.
<BLANKLINE>
You created a bond?
<BLANKLINE>
That's cool:
<BLANKLINE>
but no

No Spaces are printed at the beginning of a line or at the end of a line

>>> text_indentation(" Â  Excuse me.")
Excuse me.
<BLANKLINE>

>>> text_indentation("No way.      ")
No way.
<BLANKLINE>

Texts not ending with those characters don't get a new line

>>> text_indentation("Can you tell me what's going on here")
Can you tell me what's going on here

Text must be a string or a error will be raised
